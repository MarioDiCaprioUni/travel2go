        All roads lead to Rome, so they say. Or maybe it should be all interests. Food lovers can spend a lifetime
        sampling the city’s pasta—impossibly buttery cacio e pepe, rich and meaty carbonara. Art fanatics can tour
        masterpiece after masterpiece by the likes of Michelangelo and Raphael. And history buffs can explore an absurd
        amount of ancient sites, from the Pantheon to the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain. But just when you think you
        have Rome figured out, it surprises you. Just look at its nightlife, which rivals any European capital with its
        up-all-night energy and legendary clubbing. And even if your bar-crawl days are behind you, it’s worth joining
        locals in the Roman tradition of an aperitivo (pre-dinner drink) to toast this eternal city.

        It may be known as Second City, but Chicago rivals any of the world’s great destinations from NYC to London
        to Hong Kong. Yes, Chi-town has everything: stunning architecture and museums, forward-thinking chefs,
        laugh-your-heart-out comedy clubs, a thriving craft brew scene, and so much more. With 77 neighborhoods across
        the city, it’s impossible to see it all but we recommend you start with the show-stoppers in and around the Loop
        and Gold Coast (Cloud Gate, the Museum of Contemporary, an architecture tour along the Chicago River, to name a few).
        Then move beyond the city center to explore smaller neighborhoods like Old Town, home to the famous Second City comedy
        club, and Wicker Park, where you’ll find artsy boutiques and killer coffee shops.

        From its fashion to its architecture to its political history, Berlin has always been edgy. The Berlin Wall is
        a sobering reminder of the hyper-charged postwar atmosphere, and yet the graffiti art that now covers its remnants
        has become symbolic of social progress. Check out the Weltzeituhr (world time) Clock, topped by a model of the
        solar system, then turn back time by dining at the historic Zur Letzten Instanz, a 16th century restaurant that
        was frequented by Napoleon and Beethoven.

        After a pair of quiet years, Japan has reopened its borders, and Tokyo’s distinct energy is back in full force.
        There's so much to see, including new shopping megaplexes, elegant hotels, and restaurants with rising-star chefs
        at their helms. Locals and visitors are once again rushing to futuristic skyscrapers and the famous Shibuya Crossing,
        an intersection that's so lively, it feels like a flash mob. But these places are a bit less hectic in winter and
        early spring. Even better, March and April bring cherry blossom season, when the whole city slows down to stroll
        past thousands of pink blossoms. You can find other quiet moments in ancient Buddhist temples and peaceful gardens,
        or those secret ramen counters, chill record bars, and other little gems often hiding in plain sight.

        San Francisco has a personality as big and bold as the Golden Gate Bridge, but that personality changes neighborhood
        to neighborhood. Consider the tea rooms and mah jong parlors of Chinatown, the lingering hippie chic of Haight-Ashbury,
        and the boisterous family fun of Ghirardelli Square. The city is also home to one of the country's most dynamic food
        scenes, from beloved Mission District burrito joints to Michelin-starred dining rooms. When your legs get tired from
        exploring, hitch a ride on a cable car and take in those hilltop views.

        Vast and cinematic, this famed national park is an absolute showstopper, with bands of red rocks and carved
        canyon walls as far as the eye can see. No wonder it draws millions of visitors every year. But if you want solo
        time in nature, you’re in luck. The window of December to February gets only a sliver of summer’s peak crowds.
        Yes, it’s cold—highs tend to hover around 45 degrees—but this season has its own attractions, like seeing the
        Canyon’s walls dusted in snow. South Rim trails also stay open for the most part. One good bet: The Hermit Trail
        tends to stay relatively snow- and ice-free because of its lower elevation and sunlight exposure. Need another reason
        to come? January is also when the park’s historic photo studio, Kolb Studio, has its art exhibition and sale.
